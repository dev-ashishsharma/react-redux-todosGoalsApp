# TODO & GOALS APP
This is the TODO & GOALS React & Redux application that let a user add, remove, or toggle a Todo. Along with that a user can also add & delete goals. The UI is basic & will be cleaned up via CSS in later commits.

The idea is to implement the store via redux and use the action, middleware, reducers to solidify the understanding of the Redux architecture.
